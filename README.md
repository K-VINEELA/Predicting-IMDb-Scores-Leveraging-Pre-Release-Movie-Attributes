## üìå Project Overview

### üéØ Purpose

This project forecasts IMDb scores using features available before a movie‚Äôs release‚Äîlike director reputation, social media engagement, and genre‚Äîusing regression and classification models. Results are further interpreted using GPT to provide filmmakers with human-readable recommendations for improving their film‚Äôs reception.

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Source**: IMDb 5000 Movie Dataset
- **Records**: 5,043 movies across 100+ years and 66 countries
- **Features**: 27 predictors including genre, director, actors, budget, gross earnings, reviews, Facebook likes
- **Target Variable**: `imdb_score`

Key engineered features include:
- `Directors Avg_IMDb`: Aggregated IMDb score of past movies by a director
- `Expected Engagement`: Weighted metric derived from user and critic review counts

---

## üîç Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

- Removed or imputed missing values (e.g., facenumber_in_poster, content_rating)
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables; target encoding for high-cardinality features
- Outlier removal using Z-score
- Standardization with `StandardScaler` for numerical features
- Simplified multi-level categories like country

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis

Insights from EDA:
- USA dominates movie production (~79%)
- Strong correlation between user engagement and IMDb scores
- Notable financial success exists even among lower-rated movies
- Social media engagement aligns with higher scores, especially for PG-13 and R-rated films

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### üìà Regression Models
Used to predict continuous IMDb scores:
- **LightGBM** (Best: R¬≤ = 0.7557, MAE = 0.355)
- **XGBoost** (R¬≤ = 0.7531)
- **Gradient Boosting** (R¬≤ = 0.7516)
- **Random Forest** (R¬≤ = 0.7148)
- **Linear Regression** (Baseline, R¬≤ = 0.6807)

### üéØ Classification Models
IMDb scores categorized into 4 classes:
- Poor (0‚Äì4)
- Average (4‚Äì6)
- Good (6‚Äì8)
- Excellent (8‚Äì10)

Models used:
- **LightGBM** (Best: Accuracy = 84.5%, F1 = 0.841)
- **Gradient Boosting** (Accuracy = 83.9%)
- **Random Forest** (Accuracy = 81.7%)

Class imbalance addressed via stratified sampling.

## ü§ñ GPT Integration

We integrated OpenAI GPT API to translate model-driven feature importances into user-friendly suggestions. This bridge between data science and creative strategy allows filmmakers to understand *why* a movie might succeed or fail and what changes could help.

Sample output:
> ‚ÄúConsider increasing social media engagement, especially on Facebook for your lead actor. Historically, higher actor_facebook_likes correlate with top-rated movies in your genre.‚Äù

## üß© Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge**: Class imbalance in IMDb categories  
  **Solution**: Stratified sampling to preserve proportions

- **Challenge**: High-cardinality features like director/actor names  
  **Solution**: Aggregated historical averages (e.g., Director Avg IMDb)

- **Challenge**: Missing data in `budget`, `gross`  
  **Solution**: Row removal for critical features; imputation for less critical ones

## üß† Conclusion

This project provides a powerful framework for predicting IMDb scores using only pre-release data. The LightGBM model demonstrated the best performance in both regression and classification tasks. GPT integration enhances interpretability, empowering filmmakers to optimize strategies before release.

## üîÆ Future Scope

- Incorporate additional features like trailer view counts, sentiment from social media, and media coverage
- Extend predictions to box office revenue, ROI, and other commercial metrics
- Apply framework to web series, video games, or global TV shows
